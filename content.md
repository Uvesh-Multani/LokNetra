Project Report: Face-Based Employee Attendance System
1. Project Overview
a. Project Title
Face-Based Employee Attendance System

b. Project Description
The Face-Based Employee Attendance System represents a significant leap forward in workforce management, engineered to dismantle the inefficiencies and inaccuracies inherent in conventional attendance tracking methods. In many organizations, traditional systems—ranging from paper-based sign-in sheets to RFID card swipes—suffer from critical vulnerabilities. They are not only administratively burdensome and time-consuming but are also easily exploitable through practices like "buddy punching," where one employee clocks in for another. This leads to significant payroll leakage, inaccurate labor data, and a general lack of accountability. This project confronts these issues head-on by deploying a state-of-the-art solution built on the foundations of artificial intelligence and computer vision.

Our system introduces a frictionless, secure, and highly reliable attendance process. The core of the application is a sophisticated facial recognition engine. During the one-time enrollment process, an administrator captures images of an employee, which are then processed by a deep learning model (`facenet-pytorch`) to generate a unique numerical vector, or "facial embedding." This embedding acts as a digital biometric signature, securely stored in the system's database and linked to the employee's profile.

For daily attendance, the employee simply glances at a camera connected to the system. The application captures a live video frame, detects the face, computes its facial embedding in real-time, and compares it against the entire database of stored embeddings. This matching process is completed in milliseconds, allowing the system to instantly and accurately identify the employee and log their check-in or check-out time with a precise timestamp. This entire interaction is seamless and contactless, promoting both efficiency and hygiene.

Beyond the AI-powered core, the project delivers a comprehensive management platform through a user-friendly web interface built with Django. This administrative dashboard serves as the central hub for all HR-related attendance tasks. From here, authorized personnel can manage the entire employee lifecycle: adding new hires, updating employee details, and deactivating records for those who have left the organization. The dashboard also provides powerful reporting tools, enabling managers to generate insightful attendance reports—daily, weekly, or monthly—with just a few clicks. This immediate access to accurate data empowers management to make informed decisions, monitor punctuality, and streamline the payroll process. By integrating these components, the project delivers a holistic, end-to-end solution that not only enhances operational productivity but also fosters a culture of accountability and provides a foundation of trustworthy data for strategic HR management.

3. Methodology
a. Approach
The project was executed using the Agile development methodology, specifically inspired by the Scrum framework. This iterative approach allowed for flexibility and continuous improvement. The project was divided into two-week "sprints," each with a specific set of goals. At the end of each sprint, the completed work was reviewed, and feedback was incorporated into the plan for the next sprint. This ensured the project stayed on track and aligned with its objectives.

b. Phases
Requirement Gathering: In-depth analysis of the problem domain, identification of stakeholders, and creation of a detailed Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
Design: This phase involved creating a high-level system architecture diagram, designing the database schema with Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and creating wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
Development: The core phase where the application was built. This involved writing Python code for the Django backend, implementing the facial recognition pipeline with PyTorch and OpenCV, and developing the frontend with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Testing: A multi-layered testing strategy was employed. Unit tests validated individual functions, integration tests ensured different modules worked together correctly, and end-to-end tests simulated real-world user scenarios.
Deployment: The application was prepared for a production environment. This included configuring a production-grade web server (like Gunicorn), setting up static file serving, and managing environment variables securely.
c. Testing and Quality Assurance
A rigorous QA process was central to the project. Automated tests were written for critical backend logic to prevent regressions. Manual testing was performed to assess usability and discover bugs that automated tests might miss. Performance testing was planned to simulate high loads and identify potential bottlenecks in the database or recognition engine. Code reviews were conducted regularly to enforce coding standards, improve readability, and share knowledge.
d. Risk Management
A proactive risk management strategy was implemented. A risk register was maintained to track potential issues. For technical risks, fallback plans were considered, such as using an alternative face recognition library if the primary one proved unsuitable. For security risks, best practices like using environment variables for secrets, hashing passwords, and implementing Django's built-in security features were strictly followed.

4. Technologies Used
a. Programming Languages
Python: The primary language for the backend, chosen for its extensive libraries for web development (Django) and AI/ML (PyTorch, OpenCV), and its clean syntax.
JavaScript: Used for frontend interactivity, such as providing real-time feedback on the UI during face capture and making asynchronous requests to the backend.

### 8. Project Setup and Execution Guide

This guide provides detailed step-by-step instructions to set up the project environment, run the application, and create the necessary administrator account to manage the system.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python (version 3.8 or higher)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git for version control

**Step 1: Clone the Project Repository**

First, you need to get a local copy of the project. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following `git` command to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd Face-Based-Emp-Attandance-System
```
This will download the project into a new directory named `Face-Based-Emp-Attandance-System` and navigate you into it.

**Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It is a best practice to create a virtual environment for each Python project to manage its dependencies independently.

*   **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
*   **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
After activation, you will see `(venv)` prefixed to your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

**Step 3: Install Required Dependencies**

The project's dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install all of them using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command reads the file and installs the exact versions of all the necessary libraries, including Django, PyTorch, and OpenCV. This might take a few minutes.

**Step 4: Initialize the Database**

The project uses a database to store all its data. Django needs to create the necessary tables based on the project's models. This is done through migrations.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
This command looks for any changes in the data models and applies them to the database. On the first run, it will create the `db.sqlite3` file and set up the entire database schema.

**Step 5: Create an Administrator (Superuser) Account**

To access the admin dashboard and manage the system (e.g., enroll employees), you need to create a superuser account.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You will be prompted to enter a **username**, **email address**, and **password**. Choose a strong password and remember these credentials, as you will need them to log in.

**Step 6: Run the Development Server**

Now that the setup is complete, you can run the application.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The server will start, and you will see output in your terminal indicating that the application is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

**Step 7: Access and Use the Application**

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the main application.
2.  To access the admin panel, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.
3.  Log in using the superuser credentials you created in Step 5.
4.  Once logged in, you can start managing employees, enrolling their faces, and viewing attendance records through the administrative interface.




# Face-Based Employee Attendance System

## 1. Overview
A web application that leverages real-time face recognition to handle employee check-in and check-out, replacing manual or card-based attendance systems.  
Employees simply stand in front of a webcam; the system recognises the face, records the timestamp, and stores it in the database.

## 2. Tech Stack
| Layer            | Technology / Library                         | Purpose                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend**      | **Python 3.8**, **Django 4.2**               | Web framework, ORM, routing, auth              |
| Face recognition | `facenet-pytorch`, `face_recognition` (dlib) | Extract face encodings & compare faces         |
| Image handling   | **OpenCV**                                   | Capture / manipulate frames                    |
| Data             | **SQLite** (default) or any Django DB        | Stores employees & attendance logs             |
| Frontend         | **HTML + Bootstrap 5**                       | Responsive UI                                  |
| Browser API      | `getUserMedia`                               | Access client-side webcam                      |
| Misc.            | **Pygame**                                   | (Optional) play audio cues on events           |

## 3. Key Features
1. **Face-based Check-In / Check-Out**  
   - Two distinct buttons trigger the desired action.  
   - Validation prevents double check-ins/outs or invalid sequences.

2. **Employee CRUD & Authorisation**  
   - Admin can add, update, delete, and “authorise” (activate) employees.  
   - Deleting automatically invalidates cached encodings.

3. **Attendance Reports**  
   - Daily attendance list page.  
   - Export to CSV / Excel.

4. **Session-based Authentication**  
   - Django’s auth system with admin/user roles.

5. **Caching for Speed**  
   - In-memory cache of face encodings to avoid recomputing on every request.

## 4. How It Works
1. **Registration**  
   Admin uploads an employee photo.  The system encodes and stores the face vector alongside employee data.

2. **Mark Attendance**  
   a. Browser loads `/attendance/mark/` and calls `getUserMedia` → live video element.  
   b. On button click, the current frame is drawn to a hidden `<canvas>`, converted to Base-64, and POSTed to `/attendance/process/` with an `action` field ([check_in](cci:1://file:///e:/Face-Based-Emp-Attandance-System/app1/models.py:28:4-34:61) or [check_out](cci:1://file:///e:/Face-Based-Emp-Attandance-System/app1/models.py:36:4-42:97)).  
   c. Backend decodes the image, finds the face, compares encodings, identifies the employee, and updates today’s record.  
   d. JSON response returns a friendly message; JS shows a Bootstrap alert.

3. **Listing & Reports**  
   Regular Django ListViews/Function views fetch data and render Bootstrap tables.  Links allow CSV / XLSX export.

## 5. Requirements
| Requirement                      | Minimum Version |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Python                            | 3.8             |
| pip packages (see `requirements.txt`) | facenet-pytorch, opencv-python, django, dlib / face_recognition, openpyxl, pygame |

Hardware:  
- A webcam on the client computer (works in Chrome/Edge/Firefox).  
- Reasonable CPU; GPU OPTIONAL but speeds up `facenet-pytorch`.

OS:  
Project tested on Windows 10; should run on macOS/Linux with the same packages (dlib sometimes needs build tools).
